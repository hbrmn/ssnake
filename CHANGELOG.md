Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.5] - up to 2024-05-29
### Added
- Phasing: support for 2nd order phasing (credits: Florian Schreiner)
- Save to ascii: 2D data now is saved with the 2nd axis described in the header.
- MQMAS model fitting: foldF1 option site resonating outside current spectral window can show as folded signals.
- STMAS ratio for processing (apodization, shearing)
- Tool to scale Carrier and Reference frequencies as an alternative to scale SW in MQMAS experiments.
- Option in 'Fit all' action to copy parameters incrementally after each fit. This can speed up fit in case of smoothly 
  evolving dataset between each row.
- Option to shift axis when Rolling data. Correction of D1 folded site is now much easier.
### Changed
- WindowsRun.bat updated: Check for PYTHON4SSNAKE variable to find the python interpreter
- Better import of Bruker data (credits: Julien Trébosc):
   + Improved reference frequency loading.
   + Added better loading of nD and hypercomplex datasets.
- Behavior is changed for some MQMAS processing depending on spin and MQ. 
  Some shearing ratio and SW scaling sign may be different. Especially scaling 
  SW will never be done with negative anymore. Dimension D1 should be reversed instead 
  (or FID complex conjugated).
- Updated ReferenceManual
### Fixed
- Better text output for history of several functions (credits: Famlam)
- More error checking when inserting workspaces (credits: Famlam)
- Bruker spectral data: better use of NC and NC\_proc scaling factors (credits: Julien Trébosc)
- Bruker spectral data: fix detecting hypercomplex data
- Bruker digital filter problems for TopSpin v1.3 or earlier
- Bruker SF not properly read in 1D experiments
- Some fixes and warning suppression in Bruker parameter import 
   + raw strings for re with \
   + allow non ascii char in parameter sets (utf-8 or latin-1)
- Windows build: fixed save figure output in PDF/SVG/EPS format
- Saving to Matlab: made sure naming is valid, so data can be loaded in Matlab (credits: Famlam)
- Saving to Matlab: fix for newer numpy/scipy versions
- Decreasing size of data now keeps the custom x-axis if set.
- Chemagnetics data: fixed loading function.
- Fixed some numpy code that was deprecated.
- Macro menu operations now work from fitting windows
- Pq calculation in Czjzek plot corrected. 
- Hilbert transform now OK: FT-HT-iFT now result in identical FID as initial FID (was time reversed)
- fix bug #114: changing CSA definition in multi 1D fit now converts all rows to new definition 

## [1.4] - 2022-09-25
### Added
- Export to CSV file option.
- Fitting: color boxes added to interface, indicating color per site
- Bruker fid load now works for up to 8 dimensions
- Custom x-axis can be restored after an operation cleared this

- Dipolar tool: Now also calculates second moments (credits: Henrik Bradtmüller)
- Fitting: Include separate Lorentz value for satellite transitions (credits: Julien Trébosc)
- Fitting: Adds average Pq and peak Cq values to the Czjzek Distribution Plot (credits: Henrik Bradtmüller)
